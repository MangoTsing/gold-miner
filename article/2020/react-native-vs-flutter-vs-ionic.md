![](https://tva1.sinaimg.cn/large/007S8ZIlly1gj7mdcoaldj30m80eut9w.jpg)

无论你是计划投资一个移动应用，还是打算将线下实体店改成网店，你最关心的一定是为你的业务使用最佳的解决方案。

你注意到了吗？在 Google Play 里面大约的 280 万个应用，以及在 Apple App Store 里面的 220 万个应用里，仅仅只有很少的一些应用成为行业龙头。

在这些行业的不同领域内，有一些龙头品牌占领了市场最大的份额，例如：

* **电商应用程序：** 亚马逊，Flipkart，eBay，阿里巴巴等。预计将在 [2020 年产生超过 24116 亿的收入](https://www.statista.com/outlook/243/100/ecommerce/worldwide#market-revenue)。
* **游戏应用程序：** Google Play 游戏，Pokemon Go，Candy Crush Saga，和 Lucky Money 是最受欢迎的 iOS 应用分类，[占活跃应用的 25%](https://www.statista.com/statistics/580150/most-popular-us-gaming-apps-ranked-by-audience/) 并且在美国的用户一个月超过 1874 万。
* **在线送餐应用程序：** 在叫外卖时，Grubhub，Doordash，UberEats，Postmates，Instacart 等是其中一些龙头应用的名字。
* **社交媒体应用程序：** Instagram，Facebook，Messenger，Whatsapp 等。
* **娱乐应用程序：** 每月[有 570 亿以上的用户](https://www.statista.com/statistics/579479/most-popular-us-music-video-apps-ranked-by-audience/)访问YouTube，Netflix，Apple Music，Spotify，Pandora Radio，Amazon Prime Video，Google Play 音乐，Hulu 等。

关键问题是究竟什么使他们成功，并帮助他们在市场上独树一帜？可能许多人迫切想跟风模仿他们的应用，但在此之前，你需要先找到他们成功的秘诀。

有太多的因素会影响成功，包括功能，复杂性，UX/UI 设计，后端，前端，开发人员的技术等等。但真正的成功在于他们选择开发应用使用的技术。

不管你的应用有多么出色的创意，以及有什么独特的东西融入你的应用，如果你选择了老旧、乏力、过时的编程语言，那可能会让你的全部投入增加风险。

而且如果我们考虑到移动应用程序的趋势，和业务增长带来的需求，那么可以肯定的说，现在的企业家对跨平台移动应用更感兴趣。由于混合应用可以帮助通过不同的平台，大规模的找到用户定位，因此企业家都渴望雇佣一支拥有开发跨平台应用经验都开发者团队。

还有一个关键问题：你应该选择哪种编程语言来开发应用程序？

在使用顶级的跨平台移动端应用框架开发混合应用时，[React Native](https://reactnative.dev/)、[Flutter](https://flutter.dev/) 以及 [Ionic](https://ionicframework.com/) 都是开发者社区中的龙头。

现在，当你需要在这三个优秀的移动应用开发框架中进行选择时，真正当挑战接踵而至。不用担心，我们只需要比较每个框架的要点，以帮助你轻松的找到最适合你业务需求的框架。

让我们开始给每个框架都做一个简短的介绍吧。

## 开源跨平台移动应用开发框架的标准线

#### 总览

Flutter 和 React Native 都是高级软件开发的成套工具，但是 Flutter 是由 Google 开发和支持，而 React Native 是由 Facebook 开发。Ionic 是最古老的编程语言之一，由 Driffy Co 开发。

#### React Native

React Native 是一款开源框架，并在 2015 年开始由多种语言编写，包括 JavaScript、Swift、Objective-C、C++ 和 Python。它基本上提供了在 iOS、Android 和 Windows 平台，开发一款优秀跨平台应用程序需要的所有工具和服务，而且由它开发的应用拥有近似原生应用的性能。

主要使用者：在很短的时间内，这个框架就被用于开发各种应用，包括 Instagram，Facebook，Airbnb，Walmart，UberEats 等等。

#### Flutter

Flutter 由 Google 提供支持，并且为了帮助开发者能够开发出漂亮，并且风格近似与本机原生系统的应用，它在开发过程中增加了一个强大的渲染层。它提供了自己的渲染引擎，开箱即用的窗口小组件，命令行工具，API 等等，这些都可以使整个开发过程更加轻松。但是，和 React Native 进行比较，它在 2018 年才刚刚开始流行。

主要使用者：虽然 Flutter 是近期才推出的新框架，但是 Google Ads、Alibaba、Reflectly、Birch Finance 等公司已经开始使用了。

#### Ionic

Ionic 在 2013 年作为开源的跨平台移动开发 SDK 推出。由于它使用了包括 HTML5、CSS 和 SaaS 在内的各种技术，因此使用 Ionic 可以更轻松的构建一个跨平台的移动应用程序。

主要使用者：Ionic 在行业内已经有很长的时间了，它被用作诸如 Sworkit、JustWatch、MarketWatch 等应用程序的构建。

现在让我们着眼于关键点，通过下面简单的比较可以帮助你了解每个框架的优劣之处。

## 比较 React Native、Flutter 和 Ionic 的主要属性

由于每家企业都有不同的产品需求，并且招聘的移动应用开发团队技术水平也略有不同。因此，适合一家初创企业的框架在另一家初创企业中未必适用。所以我们这里将会讨论开发人员在选择框架时，最关心的那些特点。

#### 1. 编程语言

**总览：** React Native 是基于 JavaScript，Flutter 使用 Google 的内部编程语言 Dart，而 Ionic 使用多种语言。

**React Native：** 在选择是哪种编程语言的框架时，React Native 可能是开发人员的首选，因为它基于 JavaScript，而 JavaScript 是目前开发混合应用程序最流行且具有动态性的语言之一。此外，这款框架结合了 JavaScript 和 React 的所有优点，并得到了 Facebook 的支持。React Native 使它与其他编程语言区分开来的地方在于，它可以在需要的时提供用 Swift、Objective-C 或 Java 编写一些组件的能力。

**Flutter：** 由于 Flutter 是 Google 的一个小宝贝，因此它使用了一个内部编程语言，[Dart](https://dart.dev/),可以帮助你开发 Android、iOS 和 web 应用程序。相比于 JavaScript，Dart 仍然是一种罕见的编程语言。但是尽管这是一个新语言，但在未来几年中仍然具有极大的潜力席卷整个行业。

**Ionic：** 它使用多种技术（包括 HTML5、CSS 以及 JavaScript）来开发和运行应用程序，并且可以通过 [Cordova wrapper](https://cordova.apache.org/) 来使用原生平台的一些控制器。为了提高代码的质量，你还可以使用 Ionic 的同时使用 TypeScript。

#### 2. 代码的运行和复用

**总览：** 在为跨平台应用程序招聘跨平台应用开发者时，代码的可复用性是公司最关心的一点。这三个框架都使用不同的代码执行策略。React Native 遵循 「 learn once and write anywhere 」，Ionic 使用 「 one code base, any platform 」，而 Flutter 为你提供了一组高级功能可以提升你的编程速度。

**React Native:** The prime principle of writing code with React Native is clearly portrayed for you: A single code base can be used to develop multiple apps for various platforms including Android, iOS, and Windows. This will help developers to build better apps in a short time span.

**Flutter:** The standard reason behind the increasing popularity of Flutter is that it provides a comprehensive toolkit that helps developers create modern apps with ready-to-use widgets, APIs, and its own rendering engine. By leveraging the rich feature set of Flutter, developers can create beautiful mobile experiences.

**Ionic:** Its simple mantra of “one code base, any platform” provides the privilege of reusing the code base for various applications. By using the same code base, developers can build a highly interactive app in a quick time frame.

#### 3. Popularity and Community

**Overview:** If you are assuming that the oldest framework has the highest popularity and community support, then you might be mistaken at this point. According to [Statista](https://www.statista.com/statistics/869224/worldwide-software-developer-working-hours/), React Native is used by 42% of developers, whereas Flutter, despite being a new framework, is used by 39% of developers, and Ionic is used by 18% of developers. If we compare all these three frameworks, then React Native might be at the top position. However, it has the same percentage of developers as in 2019, and Ionic has been reduced from 28% to 18%, whereas Flutter has shown a bar rising from 30% to 39%.

**React Native:** While evaluating the community support of frameworks, undoubtedly React Native will easily steal the show. Since it’s based on the most essential web development language, JavaScript, and utilizes popular React libraries, the network of developers is speedily growing as compared to Flutter and Ionic. But according to [Github](https://github.com/facebook/react-native), React Native has 89.7K stars, 3.7K watches, and 19.9K forks.

**Flutter:** Flutter is a recently launched framework for the community, so compared to React Native and Ionic, it has a small community. But the fact that it’s intensely advertised by Google and is rapidly increasing in popularity will soon make this framework a major thing in the mobile world. Moreover, in just a short timeframe, [Flutter](https://github.com/flutter/flutter) has achieved 99.2K stars, 13.7K forks, and is watched by 3K developers, leaving aside React Native and Ionic.

**Ionic:** Being one of the oldest frameworks, Ionic has often improved its framework. It has the second-highest community support and a great marketplace. In terms of [popularity](https://github.com/ionic-team/ionic-framework), it has 41.6K stars, 13.3K forks, and is watched by 1.8K developers.

#### 4. Performance

**Overview:** For any business, app performance is one of the most crucial deciding factors. The performance of the app depends on various factors, including the efficiency of writing code in that particular framework. But here we will evaluate performance by simply analyzing the runtime of the app.

**React Native:** Since this framework uses native APIs and components, it helps you build an application that provides a native look and feel.

**Ionic:** Unlike other frameworks, Ionic uses advanced web technologies, like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, that help in creating high performing hybrid apps. But it requires plugins and third-party packages to wrap your application in a native cover.

**Flutter:** Undoubtedly React Native and Ionic both deliver excellent performance, but Flutter goes a step ahead as it provides ready-to-use plugins, a wide range of widgets, and its own rendering engine that helps in building beautiful, high-performance cross-platform applications.

#### 5. User interface

**Overview:** It’s only the app design and the user interface of the app that help users determine whether they will continue using this app further or uninstall it. React Native uses the React library to organize the UI and Ionic makes use of HTML and CSS, whereas Flutter ensures the best user interface comparatively to others.

**React Native:** To deliver a native-like app experience, React Native utilizes React libraries that offer amazing UI.

**Ionic:** Ionic is totally dependant upon web technologies, like HTML and CSS, to deliver a native-type app experience, but it also accesses Cordova to gain the look and feel of native apps.

**Flutter:** Undoubtedly, Flutter provides the [best user interface](https://flutter.dev/docs/development/ui) by simply skipping interactive bridges with native components, which is why a large number of mobile app development companies prefer to use Flutter for developing cross-platform apps. It’s true that Ionic can provide a cross-platform application, but as it uses Cordova for running JavaScript, it fails to beat the efficiency and performance of Flutter and React Native.

#### 6. Current state of usage

**Overview:** It’s perfectly fine to get impressed with any technology, but how the real world uses that framework or thinks about it is what really matters.

**React Native:** Whether it's about mobile or web app development, JavaScript is the king of programming languages. It has not only maintained its position in the top five programming languages but also keeps its importance in the app development industry. React Native is based on Javascript, and this is why a couple of leading companies, including Facebook, and Airbnb, have adopted this framework for development.

However, on the other side, you can’t ignore the fact that [Airbnb](https://medium.com/airbnb-engineering/react-native-at-airbnb-f95aa460be1c) later switched to another technology. And because of this movement, the React Native team is working on getting rid of some of the documented limitations and problems.

**Flutter:** Despite being relatively new, Flutter has already set the benchmark in the development industry by simply providing a complete software development kit to developers. With Flutter, not only is it easier to build beautiful apps, but it’s also quicker to edit code with the hot reload feature.

With plenty of advanced features, Flutter has already impressed approximately 39% of developers and has been used to build some major applications, including Google’s AdWords. The way Flutter is rising in popularity and usage, it’s safe to predict that more great apps will be developed with Flutter. All you need is to hire an app developer with a solid command of this framework.

**Ionic:** Comparatively, Ionic is the oldest framework, but still it has not developed any groundbreaking, outstanding app. Still, [86,400 development teams](https://ionicframework.com/customers) have leveraged Ionic to develop Android and iOS apps.

#### 7. Cost of app development

**Overview**: Whether you are a startup or an entrepreneur, app development cost is one of everyone’s major concerns. The cost of app development is directly related to how long it takes to develop the app, the cost of the developer, and the libraries used.

**React Native:** React Native is an open source framework and allows developers to access a wide choice of libraries for free. All you need to do to reap the maximum benefits of this framework is to hire a software development company that has a skilled team.

**Flutter:** Flutter is also an open source platform that allows developers to access a wide choice of widgets, libraries, and APIs for free. Moreover, you can easily find Flutter app developers with a starting price of $18 to $35+ all across the world.

**Ionic:** It is a free, open source cross-platform mobile app framework, but for a professional development environment, you need to go for the paid version. However, Iconic Pro can easily expedite the development process and make it easier for developers to create an application in real time.

## Which Framework Will You Choose for Cross-Platform App Development?

After all these metrics and comparison, you need to first decide whether you want to stick with native languages, like Swift, Object C, C++, and Java, and want to proceed with the hassle of learning and mastering two different languages for developing two different apps. Or do you want to choose one framework that works well on multiple platforms?

Let’s assume you are ready to go with a cross-platform app development framework. How will you decide which is the best technology fit for you, even after reading this entire article?

Let’s make it simple for you.

If you’re looking for wrapped app solutions, then Ionic is the perfect solution for you. But as Ionic uses third-party components or Cordova to give a native-like feel to the app, it fails to beat the efficiency and performance of Flutter and React Native. On the other hand, Ionic ensures you a super-fast development experience and enables you to build two apps with one stack in less time.

Secondly, if performance and the need to access a wide range of native device features are priorities, then Flutter and React Native can be the ultimate choice for you.

Rest easy — everything has been explained in detail above.

## Final Thoughts

To wrap up this article, it’s worth saying that our aim is not to announce the winner of the cross-platform app development frameworks. Instead, the simple aim of this article is to help you understand the strengths and limitations of these three top cross-platform frameworks so you can make a perfect choice for your app development.

After evaluating various survey reports and statistics, this article has analyzed the information and carried out a detailed comparison between these three titans.
